# Memory Work

Memory Work is a collective futures project. Through a continuous program of workshops, speculative audio works, filmic worldbuilding, durational performances, a public monument, and the Memory Work Collective — this project reimagines futures of Toronto that prioritize collective care and a politics that value nurturing over growth. The scenario is not a prediction. It is neither visionary, as in preferred, nor is it admonitory, as in dystopian. The work is intended as material for meditation, stimuli for imagining collective future memory. We encourage you to use its resources; question and iterate on the scenarios and worldbuilding; generate your own future experiences, visions, vignettes, and artifacts.

# Speculative Audio
