# Digital and/as Public Space

In 2020 The Bentway, a land conservancy and non-profit in downtown that manages about 10 acres of reclaimed edgelands under a highway in downtown Toronto, had to temporarily go remote. What would ditial technologies mean for such a site-specific organization, with a mandate to create social engagement in public space? What would public space even become? 

In 2021 From Later partnered with The Bentway to engage in several months of research-creation. Two main outputs emerged: an experimental urban-scale game, _Directions to Nowhere in Particular_ and a constructible report, _A Field Guide to the Digital Real_. 

The Bentway's documentation of the project is [available here](https://www.thebentway.ca/stories/digital-and-as-public-space/), _Directions to Nowhere_ is [available here](https://www.directionstonowhere.com/), and the _Field Guide_ is [available here](https://www.are.na/block/15581182).

## Approach

How will digital technologies affect the processes that generate public space? Should we think of digital and networked technologies as becoming a "hybrid" with IRL? And is it possible to transpose the concept of public space online? Are there "digital public spaces"? Are there parallels between site-specificity and (www)site-specificty? Is adaptive digital reuse possible? 

These questions opened our parterning with The Bentway for several months of exploratory research-creation, helping raise questions that could inform more inventive long-term digital strategies. Not answers, but questions interesting enough to merit exploration. 

Instead of another "futures of X (e.g. public space/digital space)" project, with its linear approach to scanning, sensemaking, and synthesis, and its assumption of knowing what X is ahead of time, we took a more experimental approach. Rather than using off-the-shelf methods, we gradually _constructed a method_ to fit the problem over the course of the project. If we're honest, that's how it should always be. Maybe not as experimental, but equally as constructed for the task at hand. (Always question the high salesmen of method – ask them for examples of the quality of their output, not their claims to surefire input).

Doing that involved iterating several parallel streams of work over the course of the project. We researched in public, constructed a public game, and held public events. The streams interacted and shaped each other over time. Instead of a linear process, we had a field of interference patterns that helped us think and experiment our way through the problem domain of digital and/as public space.


## [A Digital Garden](https://www.are.na/from-later/_field-guide-to-the-digital-real)

In kicking off the project we opened a research channel on are.na and encouraged others to add files, thoughts, and links. The channel was a micro experiment, of a kind. It asked: under what conditions might collaborative dynamics between strangers online emerge? Who would add to the channel and why? Would an ecosystem of participation emerge? Why would anyone participate? But conversely, what do we contribute to them? 

It was an experiment in the minimal conditions for micro-publics. What would happen when a site with a minimal set of instructions appeared and anyone could contribute? Everyone knows the issue with moderation online. We didn’t know how it was going to unfold. 

A number of individuals we didn't know, often pseuodnyms, participated. Sometimes strange artifacts would emerge – photos of birds along the Ottawa canal, added by someone who appeared to work for the Armed Services. We don't know why... Perhaps something with the word digital garden. Others added material that reflected their ongoing research projects and socio-technical concerns. Mostly it was just us.

We were reminded that the biggest challenge in research is not necessarily collecting interesting material. It's not about how weak your signals are or how many you have. It's the coherence that comes from the constellation of references that an individual can flash together in a single gesture. Remember how Deleuze & Guattari opened their collaboratively written _A Thousand Plateaus_? "Since each of us was several, there was already quite a crowd." Sometimes an individual is more distributed than a crowd.

Are.na's ability to link material to other channels was maybe the most interesting bit. Seeing how others placed us and our references within the messy externalized minds of their own channels. As of 2023, the channel is still vaguely active – mostly individual blocks being added to other channels, growing horizontally rather than vertically.


## [Directions to Nowhere in Particular](https://www.directionstonowhere.com/)

At the same time, we designed an urban-scale game available as a browser-based application. The game proposed randomly suggested prompts – sometimes abstract and cryptic, sometimes direct and TikTok populist – that directed users to the troubled borderlands between the digital and the urban. Hopefully, with the right conditions and right situations, it could trigger a process of perceiving, conceiving, and doing public space differently.

[![](/images/daaps_directions-examples.png)](https://www.directionstonowhere.com/)

The point wasn't to force on anyone insights about digital and/or public worlds. It was to set in motion a process of creation. Do whatever you want – most likely, ignore it. But maybe a question comes back to you on the bus, in a park, in a laneway or alley. Maybe you just explore that question virtually rather than concretely. With the virtual reality you always had: concepts, diagrams, memories. 

The game was inspired by refusing the weirdly passive yet categorical/imperative voice taken by many futurists: that some X is "transforming" some Y. In this case, "digital technologies are transforming public space." Few claims are less interesting than that voice, that equation. It's not even interesting enough to be wrong.

In any case what mattered for us were less technologies than _techniques_. We were interested in how people might go about constructing techniques by which publics come into being, and of which digital technologies are just another tool, used in ways we'd prefer not to predict.

Rather than imagining possible futures, it was more interesting to let people experiment with the potential that was already present, but whose limits weren't yet known. That made _aesthetic_ precursors more interesting to us than the futurist preference for description. We wanted to feel and experiment, not picture and discuss.

Here's a list of those who inspired the approach, and from who we liberally borrowed ideas (thank you):
* Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt
* Randonautica and other astrological low media
* Kenneth Goldsmith and conceptual writing
* Tino Sehgal and relational aesthetics
* Surveillance Camera Players, Electronic Disturbance Theater, and other tactical media projects
* Psychogeography and the situationists

### Reverse prompt engineers

We commisioned a number of friends and acquiantances to repond to a prompt of their choosing and make the results publically available, in some form. Some chose to combine prompts and create their own. Their responses were an pivotal part of the experiment-friendly research we hoped would emerge, and helped shaped a number of the ideas documented in the field guide later.

*Alyssa Alikpala responded to a prompt to "make something visible from space." The result was a giant perfect circle of bricks made on a reclaimed piece of land which juts out several kilometers into Lake Ontario: the Leslie Spit, at whose end is Thommy Thompson Park. The Spit is constructed from the waste of skyscrapers and other building materials of Toronto. Alikpala's circle was built through several days of scavenging bricks and aligning them by GPS and drone. In 2022, the circle was visible from Google Earth's landsat imagery.*

*Lauren Lee McCarthy responded on the basis of a prompt called "Automation: Choose another prompt. Get Siri, Alexa, or another virtual assistant to help you execute it." Instead of following the prompt to the letter, McCarthy created a digital clone of her own voice – raising questions around the gendering of voice assistants, the ethics of always listening devices, the blur of private and public, data doppelgangers and uncanny self-reflections, and the affective atmospheres produced by voice interfaces.*

*Melbourne-based design studio OFFICE responded to a prompt that simply said: "broadcast the soundscape." Following noise complaints from local residents in 2016, a downtown area of Melbourne was redeveloped to prevent skateboarders from using the space, which had been one of the city's most iconic locations. OFFICE responded to the prompt by recording the sound of skateboarders in another part of the city, and broadcasting it by speaker back into the banned area – re-instituing a contest over the use of public space through a (not immediately obviously) digital technique.*


## [Field Guide to the Digital Real](https://www.are.na/block/15581182)

The various streams of work and distributed experiments fed into the creation of a research report, which we initially framed through the timely idea of a field guide. However, every field guide needs a field. What was the field? Something that didn't actually exist. The apparent border between the digital and the real? The notion of hybrid (meaning digital/real) public spaces? 

We strove to twist the notion of the field guide's typical function: to catalogue and identify already-existing entities. The latter would have been more straight-forward, probably more useful. But so goes the risk of experiment. This would be a field guide for creation, not identification. For launching new techniques into the borderlands of the digital and the real. It wouldn't tell, in the imperative voice, and it wouldn't identify, in the categorical. It just sought to catalzye – here are ideas, terms, experiments from others that you might leverage to invent the meaning of digital and/as public space.

To that end, it was designed in a format that could be read straight through, but could also be rearranged by the reader. It could be imported into Miro or another digital whiteboard and reordered, or cheaply printed onto A4 and moved around, using the affordances of paper-based media – to grasp and move information. Design cues like snaking lines could let pages be connected to other pages, like a kind of jigsaw or mosaic. Admittedly, like so many design experiments, we never much played with the form after bringing it into being. 

### Micro-residencies

Documented in the field guide, but commissioned prior to its assembly, are the outcomes of a set of micro-residencies we held with researchers and artists. Prompting participants with early ideas and themes we had for the report, we let them interpret the ideas as they wanted and use the time and resources to build something they might have already had on the backburner. The ways they worked through their micro-projects were critical to the field guide.
