# Work/Place

Work and place are intimately entwined. _Where_ and _how_ we work shapes _what work we do_. What new environments, practices, rituals, tools, platforms, protocols and organizational forms will shape our work futures? This report and audio series, commissioned by Lane, a workplace experience platform acquired soon after this project, explores those questions. The project is available [here](https://www.workplace.show/) or you can scroll down for our reflections.

## Foresight Report

A 64-page report describing ongoing shifts in the landscape of work. The report outlined possible implications for organizations, and provided speculative prompts to help teams navigate an ecosystem of changing affordances and tensions. Is is available in full [here](https://assets.website-files.com/607494f4196af2355640d3cf/608949256c18731cc5c57c5d_Refactoring-Work-Futures.pdf).

Equally inspired by processual theories of organization, speculation on planetary-scale technologies, and extensions of the idea of "affordance" from psychology to organizational action, the report was tied to the uncertainty faced by .doc workers in the face of the accidental remote work experiment trigged by COVID in 2020. While notions of care work, repair, and challenging political-economic tensions surface throughout, an admitted blindspot is that the focus is largely on the experience of the middle-upper denizens of the not-so-new economcy of North America. Those who work in towers and coffee shops, during the day, almost entirely plugged into their portable work terminals (laptops and phones). But the material in the report doesn't sugercoat anything either. It asks us to confront both the purpose and unintended consequences of changes in technology and organization. 

To that end, the report is split up into a series of six "themes" that hopefully stick out from the relentless and self-fulfilling cottage industry of "future of work" reports, panels, and initiatives. These themes are organized around the idea that technology will enable organizational forms to _do new things_, i.e. to afford new kinds of collective actions, and vice-versa, that what we work on together will shape the technologies we develop.

### Temporal Agency
_New ways of plotting time and timing_ – tackles the changing organizational rhythms as softare changes what it means to coordinate across new scales, cycles, and
tempos.

### Organizational Memory
_Linking shared pasts to emerging futures_ – is about the importance of embodied cognition in the design of work processes, re-minding us that environment and mind continually loop between each other, even in the digital world.

### Continuous Sensing
_Creating the conditions for self-organizing systems_ – describes the challenges and opportunities involved in creating environments that sense themselves, and what it would mean to socially co-design them.

### Autonomous Economies
_Increasing collective capacity_ – challenges us to think about what kinds of tasks should be automated, and what forms of collective autonomy that might enable.

### Platform Conviviality
_Infrastructure and tools for scaling mutualism_ – suggests that new cooperative forms might emerge from the combination of communications technologies, governance processes, and alternative financial mechanisms.

### Atmospheres of Care 
_Collective efforts to solve problems_ – muses on the wider aims and functions of work, including the often slippery but useful term purpose, on living in a burnout society, and on why an organization might purposely set itself conflicting targets.


## Audio Series

The accompanying podcast series brought the future of work to life, imagining what practices, rituals, tools, platforms, organizational forms, and environments might feel like.  Each episode immersed listeners in a short speculative scene from the future of work inspired by the report, followed by a critical discussion exploring alternative visions of how things might unfold. Hosted by Sydney Allen-Ash, the first season featured guests Radha Mistry, Shaun Stewart, Edward Burtynsky, and Rahaf Harfoush and is available [here](https://www.workplace.show/episodes) as well as on Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

### Episode 001: Substrate, with Radha Mistry
Is there such a thing as work-life balance? And to what extent can work and life be integrated into a dignified and meaningful existence? Radha Mistry joined Sydney Allen-Ash and Lane founders, Clinton Robinson and Kofi Gyekye for a conversation about a future workplace called “The Substrate” – a membership network of interdependent support spaces.

### Episode 002: Quartz, with Shaun Stewart
How do organizations remember, think, decide, and act? How can we design and plot time to rearrange organizational rhythms and enable new ways of coordinating across scales, cycles, and tempos? Shaun Stewart joined Sydney Allen-Ash and Lane founders, Clinton Robinson and Kofi Gyekye to listen in on a new employee’s first day using Quartz – an all-sensing company clock that time-tunes tasks according to employees’ wellbeing.

### Episode 003: Naya, with Edward Burtynsky
How will the workforce shift towards climate adaptation? Is the future of work all about climate resilience and/or carbon mitigation projects? Edward Burtynsky joined Sydney Allen-Ash and Lane founders, Clinton Robinson and Kofi Gyekye for a conversation on possibilities for future roles in light of global climate crises, environmental degradation, and resource depletion.

### Episode 004: Thrive, with Rahaf Harfoush
What happens to the ways we work when we have digital-physical hybrid spaces, hybrid-companies governed by automation, and hybrid people – virtual characters, interacting as though they’re real? Rahaf Harfoush joined Sydney Allen-Ash and Lane founders, Clinton Robinson and Kofi Gyekye for a conversation on mixed-realities in the workplace as we listen to a futures true crime podcast questioning who’s at fault when an automated organizational system goes rogue.
