## [ Scenario ]

“All of You” is a love song written from the perspective of a lover in the near-future scenario, [Compersia]("/compersia"), where polyamorous relationships are as common and accepted as monogamous ones.

It tells the story of lovers looking to transition from an open relationship to something more structured – a four-person polycule, one that they will design specially to satisfy their collective needs.

In Compersia, new communication and ethics innovations empower people to design quality relationships based on the principle of compersion, where partners find joy in their partners’ joy (intimately loving another person).
