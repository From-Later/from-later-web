# Fertilizer

The first fertilization is a lexicon that develops a new vocabulary for the affordances of plant, machine, and human sensing. Drawn from fields like plant neurobiology, ecological economics, media philosophy, and engineering, the lexicon is meant to provoke new design imaginaries. To explore the project, click the headings below.

## [ About ]

Lexicons are fertilizer for new fields of inquiry. New ways of doing require new ways of perceiving and describing. This project is an effort to:
- Explore the overlaps of plant and machine intelligence to outline new loci for scenario generation and speculative design
- Gather insights from anthropologists, philosophers, ethologists, and plant neurobiologists to re-examine the relationships between nature, culture, and technology
- Envision transitions that align new ways of life to the earth’s metabolism, to its ceaseless negentropy
- Move away from exclusively human-centred concerns and towards a broader composition of heterogeneous actors

It consists of terms drawn from a range of research fields and juxtaposed in alphabetical order. Users and plant conspirators are encouraged to submit signals to our [research repository on Are.na](https://www.are.na/from-later/office-of-cyber-botanicals), or reach out to us with thoughts.

Fertilizer is a research platform for future activations. The terms are meant to generate further projects across design, art, science, engineering, and more.

## [ Context ]

Humans have never been the only planetary intelligence. While we are building planetary-scale systems of computation and calculation that exhibit certain kinds of intelligence — ones that can effectively mimic human modes of writing, visually identify objects with higher degrees of accuracy than their human counterparts, and beat humans in domain-constrained games with inhumanly beautiful styles of play – what we call the natural world is already filled with complex forms of communication, processing, creativity, and intelligence.

Animals, from vertebrates to invertebrates, corvids to cephalopods, each demonstrate forms of intelligence tightly linking what they sense to how they interact with their environments. Plants, too, sense, process, and signal. But more so than animals, their worlds are utterly foreign to ours. They are *sessile* (immobile), *autotrophic* (producing their own food), and *perpetually morphogenetic* (never stopping their growth) — with the caveat that for every rule, an exception can be found.

It is these very characteristics that make them important for imagining other worlds, in which the mutual entanglement of plant and machine intelligence can be a source of inspiration, a modality for extended and remote sensing, a field for modelling and simulation, and a domain for mutual actuation.

Exploring these entanglements is not about communicating with plants, controlling them, or projecting our aspirations onto them. It’s about interfacing with their already complex forms of phytosemiosis and cultivating an art of noticing their strangeness – a strangeness that is just as foreign as our own cultivation of machine intelligence, and just as foreign as our own perpetually redefined humanness.

This lexicon asks how we might shift the frame of speculative design to activate futures of more-than-human intelligence and design for users to come.

## [ Lexicon ]

### A

### Acoustic Observatories
The use of acoustic sensors to monitor environmental processes, such as an Australian project (<a href="https://acousticobservatory.org/">2017</a>) using 400 solar-powered audio sensors across the continent and accessible 24/7 online, or projects like Rainforest Connection’s (<a href="https://rfcx.org/">2013</a>) use of discarded cell phones to monitor illegal deforestation in the Amazon.

### Adaptive Cycles

A model for describing ecological resilience developed by C. S. Holling (<a href="https://www.resalliance.org/adaptive-cycle">1986</a>) in which systems are always in states of disequilibrium, between phases of growth or exploitation, conservation, collapse or release, and reorganization.

### Age of Entanglement

A model for describing ecological resilience developed by C. S. Holling (<a href="https://www.resalliance.org/adaptive-cycle">1986</a>) in which systems are always in states of disequilibrium, between phases of growth or exploitation, conservation, collapse or release, and reorganization.

### Agricultural Printing

An exploration by Benedikt Groß (<a href="https://benedikt-gross.de/projects/avena-test-bed-agricultural-printing-and-altered-landscapes">2013</a>) of the potential of digital technologies and programmed landscapes for farming, in which precision targeting and personalization rather than scale and homogeneity guide planting.

### Analog Computing

As distinct from digital computing, analog systems operate with real numbers, non-deterministic logic, and continuous functions, embodying complexity in their network topology rather than in code that controls the system; explored by John von Neumann (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/578873">1958</a>) in assessing parallels and disjunctions between nervous systems and computers.

### Applied Nature

Efforts to harness plants’ and other natural beings’ innate sensing capabilities to monitor and respond to changes in environments, such as DARPA efforts (<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/advanced-plant-technologies">2017</a>) to develop augmented plants as early warning signs of biochemical hazards and weapons.

### Artificial Agency

Political scientist David Runciman’s call (<a href="https://hbr.org/podcast/2020/01/superintelligence-already-rules-the-world">2018</a>) to pay more attention to the “artificial” in artificial intelligence and look at the array of already existing artificial intelligences like states and corporations that sense, process information, and pursue goals distinct from humans; described by Danny Hillis as hybrid intelligences (<a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/w_daniel_hillis-emergences">2019</a>).

### Asperity

Term used by Jay Springett (<a href="https://thejaymo.net/asperity/">2013</a>) to describe future calls for coercive, drastic, and unequal reductions in consumption and emissions as a response to climate change, akin to the deployment of austerity policies after the financial crisis.

### Astonishing Hypothesis

Hypothesis that consciousness and intelligence emerge immanently from matter itself, requiring no special substance or spirit, by Francis Crick (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Astonishing_Hypothesis">1994</a>); extended by Frank Wilczek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07735.pdf">2015</a>) to argue that all natural intelligences are simply a subset of artificial intelligence.

### Atmospheric Laboratories

A global network of scientific stations, including a ring of stations around the Arctic and mobile cruise ships hosting sensing equipment (<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11599002/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/ocean-research-done-cruise-ships/">2000</a>), that collect the data necessary for modelling our understanding of atmospheric change.

### Automation Substitution

The use of human-designed artifacts as substitutes for ecological roles held by disappearing species, such as the use of submarine robots to eliminate coral-reef-damaging starfish (<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/sea-star-murdering-robotsa-are-deployed-in-great-barrier-reef-180970177/">2018</a>), or the “flash forests” mentioned below, substituting drones for the seed dispersal of birds.

### Bestial Media Archaeology

Research program articulated by Jussi Parikka (<a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/insect-media">2010</a>) to examine the relationships between animal behaviours and the design of technologies, in particular the parallels between the swarm behaviour of insects and parallel processing in computation.

### Biomimetics

Inspired by nature in the design of form, function, or system; engineering roots in aeronautics, with dirigible pioneer George Cayley noting (<a href="https://www.j2mcl-planeurs.net/dbj2mcl/planeurs-biblio/fac-similes/On_aerial_navigation_(Cayley_1809).pdf">1809</a>) “nature is a better architect than man”; term itself coined by Otto H. Schmitt (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1664643/">1950s</a>), whose study of squid neurons inspired electronic circuits that transform analog to digital signals, still in use in most electronic devices today.

### Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSSs)

Explorations funded by NASA from the <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/class/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2017/02/Wheeler_AgricultureForSpace_PeoplePlaces_OpenAgriculture_2017.pdf">1960s</a> to build multi-species life support systems for space travel that replaced technologies by mimicking Earthly systems, centred initially on the use of algae for generating oxygen, removing waste, and providing food.

### Bioregioning

Term by John Thackara (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405872619300012">2019</a>) to orient a design program around the shared purpose of aligning urban systems and their supporting technospheres to local and bioregional topographies of energy and matter.

### Centres of Calculation

Bruno Latour’s term (<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn%3D9780674792913">1987</a>) for processes of knowledge production in the colonial era, when objects (plants, artifacts, etc.) would be made mobile, stable, and combinable so they could be taken back from colonies for study, which enabled the creation of tools for the exertion of power at a distance.

### Chthonic Sensing

The chthonic realm, or underworld, is a world inhabited by the complex symbiotic structures of plant roots, mycelia, bacteria, and insects that make up the “wood-wide web” (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/28764">1998</a>) of communication and resource distribution underneath forests, and remain largely illegible to contemporary sensing technologies (<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/wood-wide-web-underground-network-microbes-connects-trees-mapped-first-time">2019</a>).

### Chronophotography

Also known as time-lapse photography, chronophotography was used to capture the first documentation (<a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1hp9q">1898–1900</a>) of plant movement on film by Wilhelm Pfeffer, and, just like the telescope and microscope before it, made perceptible what had previously been invisible.

### Citizen Naturalists

A sub-group of citizen scientists, such as iNaturalist (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INaturalist">2008</a>), focused on distributed data gathering of the sightings, movements, and descriptions of natural organisms, and the building of knowledge infrastructures to share that information.

### Climate Leviathan

A scenario of political theology by Joel Wainwright and Geoff Mann (<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/books/2545-climate-leviathan">2018</a>) outlining a system of planetary sovereignty developed in response to climate change, invoking Hobbes’ Leviathan (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3207/3207-h/3207-h.htm">1651</a>) to describe a new ecological sovereign.
