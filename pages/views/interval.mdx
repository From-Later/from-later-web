In the midst of a seven hour lunar surface mission to collect distant crater samples, the astronaut is cognitively and physically exhausted. Mission control notifies her to standby as they go offline to troubleshoot comms. She has a twenty minute window. Tapping the EVA helmet activates Interval. The visor dims, a soothing soundscape fills the helmet, and a voice guides her through a meditation practice. A subtle glow pulses in step with their heart rate, growing slower as she relaxes…

In 2018, From Later collaborated with Maryam Nabavi of Levitate Design on prototyping products for near-term futures of passenger space travel. We designed and built Interval, a wearable device to test the effectiveness of meditation to improve individual wellbeing in extreme environments. Interval was tested during Lunares III SPECTRA–a 15-day isolated and confined lunar analogue mission simulation at Habitat Lunares in Piła, Poland.
