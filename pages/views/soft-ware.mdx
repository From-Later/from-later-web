# Soft.ware

<Label meta={meta} />

Soft.ware probes a potential future paradigm for how everyday things might be continually patched and recrafted — updated like software. The scenario imagines a culture of recycling and repair where literacies around materials science are more widely spread and people are incentivized to make their textiles and devices last longer.

*Workshop & Marketplace: Bring your clothing, wearables, bedding, or upholstery to a local Soft.ware space.*

*Contribute & Exchange: Harvest your old electronics and add kinetically powered beacons, sensors, screens, and lights to your garments.*

*Upcycle & Repair: Commit something used and apply something new — perhaps an accelerometer and some self-healing patches for your yoga pants?*

## Overview

In industrial design and material sciences, as in the textile and apparel industries, considerable research and innovation efforts go into developing sustainable new means of manufacturing. Wasteful and environmentally damaging processes tied to legacy materials nonetheless remain destructive forces in the clothing industry.

Modern manufacturing has changed our relationship to materials, distancing people from the sources of the items they buy, own, and wear. How might we be nudged to take more responsibility for where our stuff comes from and where it goes once discarded? How will we care for and repair our everyday things?

On a grassroots level, people have always coordinated gifting networks, free stores, and swap meets to divert reusable goods from landfills. Flea markets and vintage shops can also facilitate more sustainable (re)use of material culture. Cultures of repair aim to extend the lifespan of things by fixing them — rather than re-purchasing and replacing. Policies like the Care Labeling Acts of the 70s help ensure consumers are informed on how to best care for their purchases, so that their stuff might endure the wear and tear of ordinary use.

This project probes a potential future paradigm for how everyday things might be continually patched and recrafted — updated like software. Set in a near future, the speculative photo-narrative depicts a community of people actively participating in a new kind of materials ecosystem — one that demands greater responsibility for the maintenance of a product over the course of its lifecycle. It hinges on a new care labeling standard that helps people mindfully navigate supply chains. 

## Narrative

This speculative photo-narrative illustrates a mundane encounter among people in a cooperative upcycling facility: two friends are looking to patch a torn and worn-out blouse. Though they're enthusiastic about the craft atmosphere of the community space, they're disappointed to find the traditional materials they loved have become outmoded.

## Artifacts

The material care labels attached to fabrics in this scenario demonstrate how designers and consumers could navigate supply chains, the upcycling of resources, and adoption of non-traditional material tech. The labels indicate industry-standard instructions for caring for a product over the course of its lifecycle. The idea is to de-incentivize fast fashion and petroleum-based fabrics while incentivizing people to mend and patch their apparel with regenerative materials.
