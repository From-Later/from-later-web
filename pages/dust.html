Each concession stand carefully paired with a small family of specialist tending to an odd array of fibres and foods, a Fermentation Lot like this would usually pop up in any vacancy or space, but this one drew a particular crowd of traders and makers.<br><br>Biont traders swarm the daily inventory dashboard with their empty containers and carrier bags of small metals from salvaged devices. The large florescent interface from the dashboard mixed with bundles of grow lights woven throughout the open lab flicker against the Bionts as they jostle next to each other and attempt to log what’s available. The dash flashes ‘Horologium Flora’ and in fine print below a protocol of how the ‘flower clock’ works is detailed.<br><br>‍<strong><em>READ ME:</em></strong><br><strong><em>In the 1700s Carl Linnaeus wrote about alternative time telling – a clock made up of flowering plants that open and close given the time of day.

Quickly printing a long sheath, this one must have been from the late 1900s because it was still made of wood. As if it was breathing the specialist checks the material as it cascades from the contraption, pulling it gently on to a table in the lab and further evaluating it&#x27;s symptoms. Another vendor simultaneously takes 1 metre to patch a reclaimed jacket with something that strangely resembled cotton.<br><br>Two Bionts move through the space, in tandem, towards the booth...<br>: do you think Modernity coming?<br>: leaves rustle only when the wind passes through them and the sound of cars are beginning to seem foreign<br>: a lot like the latent space between a butterfly fluttering<br>: what nature is to science, faith is to fashion<br>: grabbing anything thing today?<br>: nope, I&#x27;ll pass by the lab and trade for tokens</p>

The oxyweb is spatially unbound – communities might live as niches on mainstream social networks, as parasites hijacking other groups’ platforms, or as exit-driven networks with self-hosted infrastructure. The term oxyweb is derived from the ‘love hormone’ oxytocin, and is united only by its opposition to the use of dopamine exploiting behavioural tricks and design patterns in advertising-driven mainstream social platforms.</p>

            <p>Facebook’s content moderation is currently performed by a diverse jury of 97,357 Machine Learning models. Neurodiversity in neural nets has led to improvements in decision-making around a wider variety of content. The current jury process is particularly well suited to edge cases where typical models fail to make reasonable decisions.<br><br>Facebook encourages users to submit their own Machine Learning models to the jury — currently, over 80% of the jury comprises models selected from Facebook’s user community. Guidelines on model parameters and training data are provided in Appendix E of this document. The final outcome of a jury proceeding is determined through an automated democratic process. When content passes through moderation filters, each model gets to cast a single vote assigning the given content to a category. Votes per category are tallied and simple majorities win. In case of a tie, a human moderator is alerted to make the final decision.</p>

            <p>By the time we realized the damage we had done to our world, it was too late to change our ways. We were going to suffocate. The atmospheric models said we had 200 years—maybe 250 tops—before the air thinned, incapable of shielding us from the sun.<br><br>We needed an escape. A planet-scale eject button for civilization.<br><br>At this time there were two schools of thought. The first was to look to the stars for refuge. Propulsion technology was getting good. Perhaps good enough to launch us to the next star system. Spectrometers on reconnaissance probes painted pictures of an oasis of lush, habitable planets, a few light-years away. We had two centuries to figure out a way to survive the long journey through the vacuum. As you know now, we did survive, and the rest as they say is history.<br><br>But not many remember that a second proposal was also made. There was another planet in our star system at the time, capable of sustaining life. Close to home, but a barren wasteland. A series of controlled thermonuclear reactions could bring about the right conditions for abiogenesis - the origin of life. As to plan, we deployed the bombs and set the planet on fire. But we ran out of time. We were forced to escape to the stars before getting to see the result of our handiwork.<br><br>Memory is a pendulum. Swing your mind far back to remember the past and if you let it loose just right, it will swing forward to reveal the future. On a clear night, point your telescope toward our neighbouring star, the one you call Sol. A civilization now exists that reminds me of our carefree past, long before our escape. You’ll find them on the third planet from the sun, one that&#x27;s teeming with life. We rediscovered them recently. The successful conclusion of a forgotten terraforming project.</p>

            <p>The premise that the present-day environment contains Zero Signals whose absence indicates potentially catastrophic threats is vital to the field of Strategic Foresight. A Zero Signal is <em>a sign whose very absence is the vehicle of its signification</em>.<br><br>Similar to Weak Signals, the concept of the Zero Signal arose during the Cold War, when military strategists recognized <strong>‘the absence of an enemy signal is not a signal of its absence.’</strong> Zero Signals were thus instrumental in the development of the MAD doctrine.<br><br>Zero Signals are also <strong>common in animal communication systems</strong>. For instance, it is well known that &#x27;the elephant’s alarm call is silence’ (Ardrey 1970: 75). Even more suggestive is the quasi-prosodic phenomenon that, in several types of fireflies, pulse interval is a significant element in stimulating females, and that these intervals are distinct in different species, for example, in <em>Photinus consanguineus</em> and <em>macdermotii</em>; in the related <em>lineellus</em>, furthermore, the pulse number is variable, &#x27;which further indicates the significance of pulse interval’ (Lloyd 1966: 78).<br><br>‍<em>Assessment: How Well Does Your Team Identify Zero Signals?</em></p>
