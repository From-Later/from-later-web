# Digital and/as Public Space

In response to the COVID lockdowns of 2020 [The Bentway](https://www.thebentway.ca/), a non-profit land conservancy managing 10 acres of public space reclaimed from under a highway in downtown Toronto, temporarily went remote. What would ditial technologies mean for such a site-specific organization, with a mandate to create social engagement in IRL public space? What could public space be or become? 

A year later, in 2021, From Later partnered with The Bentway to engage in several months of [research-creation](https://www.thebentway.ca/stories/digital-and-as-public-space/) on the intersection of digital and public spaces. Two outputs emerged: an experimental urban-scale game, [_Directions to Nowhere in Particular_](https://www.directionstonowhere.com/), and a constructible report, [_A Field Guide to the Digital Real_](https://www.are.na/block/15581182). 


<Label meta={meta} />

## Approach

How will digital technologies affect the processes that generate public space? Should we think of digital and networked technologies as becoming a "hybrid" with IRL? And is it possible to transpose the concept of public space online? Are there "digital public spaces"? Are there parallels between site-specificity and (web)site-specificty? Is adaptive digital reuse possible? 

These questions opened our parterning with The Bentway for several months of exploratory research-creation, helping raise questions that could inform more inventive long-term digital strategies. Not answers, but questions interesting enough to merit exploration. 

Instead of another "futures of X (e.g. public space/digital space)" project, with its linear approach to scanning, sensemaking, and synthesis, and its assumption of knowing what X is ahead of time, we took a more experimental approach. Rather than using off-the-shelf methods, we gradually _constructed a method_ to fit the problem over the course of the project. If we're honest, that's how it should always be. Maybe not as experimental, but equally as constructed for the task at hand. (Always question the high salesmen of method – ask them for examples of the quality of their output, not their claims to surefire input).

Doing that involved iterating several parallel streams of work over the course of the project. We researched in public, constructed a public game, and held public events. The streams interacted and shaped each other over time. Instead of a linear process, we had a field of interference patterns that helped us think and experiment our way through the problem domain of digital and/as public space.


## [A Digital Garden](https://www.are.na/from-later/_field-guide-to-the-digital-real)

In kicking off the project we opened a research channel on are.na and encouraged others to add files, thoughts, and links. The channel was a micro experiment, of a kind. It asked: under what conditions might collaborative dynamics between strangers online emerge? Who would add to the channel and why? Would an ecosystem of participation emerge? Why would anyone participate? But conversely, what do we contribute to them? 

It was an experiment in the minimal conditions for micro-publics. What would happen when a site with a minimal set of instructions appeared and anyone could contribute? Everyone knows the issue with moderation online. We didn’t know how it was going to unfold. 

A number of individuals we didn't know, often pseuodnyms, participated. Sometimes strange artifacts would emerge – photos of birds along the Ottawa canal, added by someone who appeared to work for the Armed Services. We don't know why... Perhaps something with the word digital garden. Others added material that reflected their ongoing research projects and socio-technical concerns. Mostly it was just us. 

[![](/images/daaps_arena.png)](https://www.are.na/from-later/_field-guide-to-the-digital-real)

We were reminded that the biggest challenge in research is not necessarily collecting interesting material. It's not about how weak your signals are or how many you have. It's the coherence that comes from the constellation of references that an individual can flash together in a single gesture. Remember how Deleuze & Guattari opened their collaboratively written _A Thousand Plateaus_? "Since each of us was several, there was already quite a crowd." Sometimes an individual is more distributed than a crowd.

Are.na's ability to link material to other channels was maybe the most interesting bit. Seeing how others placed us and our references within the messy externalized minds of their own channels. As of 2023, the channel is still vaguely active – mostly individual blocks being added to other channels, growing horizontally rather than vertically.


## [Directions to Nowhere in Particular](https://www.directionstonowhere.com/)

At the same time, we designed an urban-scale game available as a browser-based application. The game proposed randomly suggested prompts – sometimes abstract and cryptic, sometimes direct and TikTok populist – that directed users to the troubled borderlands between the digital and the urban. Hopefully, with the right conditions and right situations, it could trigger a process of perceiving, conceiving, and doing public space differently.

[![](/images/daaps_directions-examples.png)](https://www.directionstonowhere.com/)

The point wasn't to force on anyone insights about digital and/or public worlds. It was to set in motion a process of creation. Do whatever you want – most likely, ignore it. But maybe a question comes back to you on the bus, in a park, in a laneway or alley. Maybe you just explore that question virtually rather than concretely. With the virtual reality you always had: concepts, diagrams, memories. 

The game was inspired by refusing the weirdly passive yet categorical/imperative voice taken by many futurists: that some X is "transforming" some Y. In this case, "digital technologies are transforming public space." Few claims are less interesting than that voice, that equation. It's not even interesting enough to be wrong.

In any case what mattered for us were less technologies than _techniques_. We were interested in how people might go about constructing techniques by which publics come into being, and of which digital technologies are just another tool, used in ways we'd prefer not to predict.

Rather than imagining possible futures, it was more interesting to let people experiment with the potential that was already present, but whose limits weren't yet known. That made _aesthetic_ precursors more interesting to us than the futurist preference for description. We wanted to feel and experiment, not picture and discuss.

Here's a list of those who inspired the approach, and from who we liberally borrowed ideas (thank you):
* Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt
* Randonautica and other astrological low media
* Kenneth Goldsmith and conceptual writing
* Tino Sehgal and relational aesthetics
* Surveillance Camera Players, Electronic Disturbance Theater, and other tactical media projects
* Psychogeography and the situationists

### Reverse prompt engineers

We commisioned a number of friends and acquiantances to repond to a prompt of their choosing and make the results publically available, in some form. Some chose to combine prompts and create their own. Their responses were an pivotal part of the experiment-friendly research we hoped would emerge, and helped shaped a number of the ideas documented in the field guide later.

*Alyssa Alikpala responded to a prompt to "make something visible from space." The result was a giant perfect circle of bricks made on a reclaimed piece of land which juts out several kilometers into Lake Ontario: the Leslie Spit, at whose end is Thommy Thompson Park. The Spit is constructed from the waste of skyscrapers and other building materials of Toronto. Alikpala's circle was built through several days of scavenging bricks and aligning them by GPS and drone. In 2022, the circle was visible from Google Earth's landsat imagery.*

*Lauren Lee McCarthy responded on the basis of a prompt called "Automation: Choose another prompt. Get Siri, Alexa, or another virtual assistant to help you execute it." Instead of following the prompt to the letter, McCarthy created a digital clone of her own voice – raising questions around the gendering of voice assistants, the ethics of always listening devices, the blur of private and public, data doppelgangers and uncanny self-reflections, and the affective atmospheres produced by voice interfaces.*

*Melbourne-based design studio OFFICE responded to a prompt that simply said: "broadcast the soundscape." Following noise complaints from local residents in 2016, a downtown area of Melbourne was redeveloped to prevent skateboarders from using the space, which had been one of the city's most iconic locations. OFFICE responded to the prompt by recording the sound of skateboarders in another part of the city, and broadcasting it by speaker back into the banned area – re-instituing a contest over the use of public space through a (not immediately obviously) digital technique.*


## [Field Guide to the Digital Real](https://www.are.na/block/15581182)

The various streams of work and distributed experiments fed into the creation of a research report, which we initially framed through the timely idea of a field guide. However, every field guide needs a field. What was the field? Something that didn't actually exist. The apparent border between the digital and the real? The notion of hybrid (meaning digital/real) public spaces? 

We strove to twist the notion of the field guide's typical function: to catalogue and identify already-existing entities. The latter would have been more straight-forward, probably more useful. But so goes the risk of experiment. This would be a field guide for creation, not identification. For launching new techniques into the borderlands of the digital and the real. It wouldn't tell, in the imperative voice, and it wouldn't identify, in the categorical. It just sought to catalzye – here are ideas, terms, experiments from others that you might leverage to invent the meaning of digital and/as public space.

![](/images/daaps_fieldguide.png)

To that end, it was designed in a format that could be read straight through, but could also be rearranged by the reader. It could be imported into Miro or another digital whiteboard and reordered, or cheaply printed onto A4 and moved around, using the affordances of paper-based media – to grasp and move information. Design cues like snaking lines could let pages be connected to other pages, like a kind of jigsaw or mosaic. Admittedly, like so many design experiments, we never much played with the form after bringing it into being. 

### Micro-residencies

Documented in the field guide, but commissioned prior to its assembly, are the outcomes of a set of micro-residencies we held with researchers and artists. We shared early ideas and themes we had for the report with participants, but otherwise let them interpret the ideas as they wanted, letting them use the time and resources to build something they might have already had on the backburner, but inflected with a new energy or angle. The ways they worked through their mini-projects were critical to the development of the field guide.

Below are two projects, shown here as illustration. All of the projects are fully documented in the field guide.

![](/images/daaps_residencies1.png)
*Garry Ing and Dawn Walker constructed a hand-coded digital garden of terms relating to open source movements, and their interconnections. The code, which uses Jekyll to construct a static site, is available on Github under a GPL-3.0 license for others to use. You could fork and create your own. The site – which maps the past to enact possible futures – is [accessible here](https://digitalgarden.hypha.coop/).*

![](/images/daaps_residencies2.png)
*Residents from virtual care lab – Alice Zhang, Sara Suárez, Lea Rose Sebastianis – held weekly online gatherings to reflect on community governance. That process ended up initiating a participatory writing experiment called Terms that Serve Us, which temporarily repurposed Google docs to use as a meeting place and community tool. The terms – which are inventions not images – are [accessible here](https://virtualcarelab.com/terms).*

The process of taking abstract concepts (like digital gardens, or adaptive digital reuse, in the two above examples) and turning them into something concrete always reveals there is something _more to the abstraction_ than what you merely imagined. There are points of friction that emerge when you make an abstraction concrete. You realize it doesn't quite work how you thought it did – that other parts of reality, not compressed in your abstraction, actually affect it. That doesn't limit the abstraction, but causes it to expand in unexpected ways. 

Having microresidents experiment with concepts we borrowed or invented revealed angles that mere imagining would never have surfaced.

## Collective sensemaking

Everyone knows launches and panels are events to grin and bear, a necessary pain you hope provides a few tidbits of interest in return for the support of your presence. You hope the participants will at least be less bored than you, but it's by no means guaranteed. Ours was no different. 

We tried, however, to introduce a few gameshow-like participatory elements to make it more interesting. We created an open Miro board that anyone with a link (provided during the launch) could visit. Elements were not locked or controlled, so it was free to deface and rearrange as please by anyone in the audience. That was, after all, the point of the field guide. To be rearranged. We tried to introduce an element of chance to the launch to challenge ourselves, to make it more interesting than a round robin of expected talking points by the invited guests. Which, to be fair, is still what it became.

Like a school dance, participants waited at the edges of the dancefloor. Glances were exchanged, folded messages sent across the floor, but all remained still. The stability never broke. A few moved pieces of the report onto the floor, but shyness prevailed. Perhaps with another launch we'll figure out the right elements of chaos to induce more adventurous activity. It might just be hard to build an collective affective atmosphere over a tool like Zoom, which largely prevents people from talking over each other by automatically tamping the volume. 

The Miro board for the launch is still [available here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_llGH5GY=/), and coincidently the log states an anonymous visitor came by and changed the board in some microscopic way yesterday (a day in 2023, a year and a half after the project).

## Reflections

As a foresight studio, it's expected we work on images of the future. But sometimes – maybe often – explicit representations of future states are just not futuristic enough to suit the problem you face. What you need is something more experimental, conceptual, aesthetic. Less denotative, didactic, representational. 

After we launched this project, we received puzzled looks from some of those familiar with out work. "But I thought you worked on futures stuff?" For our team, it was obvious that this was such a project. Not for others, however. For some, futures stuff meant explicit images and didactic claims about the future. 

That led to one of us presenting at Primer on the experience. This case study reflects some of those ideas. 

When futures took up design over the last decade, it largely relegated design to illustration: to make better representations of the future, more immersive experiences into it. The problem is that that's not the most interesting way to engage design. Design has a more inventive element – to create new mechanisms, capacities, and affordances. Those comes about through an experimental process that reveals the present contains more potential that we realized of it. 

We hope this project is some small way pushed in that direction. Futurists of the world – you have only your images to lose, and a world of creativity to gain. Invent new methods again, don't just pull them from the shelf and repeat the same four futures ad infinitum.
