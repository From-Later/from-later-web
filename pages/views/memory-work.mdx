## Research Platform

Memory Work is a research-based future scenario. It is not a prediction. It is neither visionary, as in preferred, nor is it admonitory, as in dystopian. It is intended as material for meditation, stimuli for imagining collective future memory. We encourage you to use this as a resource, to question it and to iterate on it, generating your own future experiences, visions, vignettes, and artifacts.

The immersive audio track invites listeners to visualize — in the mind’s eye — a possible future environment. Listen at [www.memory-work.com](https://memory-work.com/)
